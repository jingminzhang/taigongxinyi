# 📚 Documentation Restructure - COMPLETED

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

Successfully reorganized the Cauldron project documentation to separate internal development docs from public-facing GitHub Pages content, with clear presentation of the three-tier system vision.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Internal Documentation Organization
**Moved to `docs/internal/` (private development docs):**
- `api_scheduling_strategy.md`
- `baxian_sanqing_system_guide.md`
- `Force_Anti_Monologue_Techniques.md`
- `liao.md`
- `rapidapi_yahoo_finance_guide.md`
- `tianxia.md`
- `earlycall.md`
- `index_professional.md`
- `analysis/` directory (market analysis reports)
- `mcp/` directory (MCP implementation details)
- `setup/` directory (internal setup guides)
- `strategies/` directory (internal strategy documents)
- `technical/` directory (technical implementation details)

### 2. Public Documentation Structure
**Clean public docs for GitHub Pages:**

```
docs/
├── index.md                    # 🏛️ Main project overview with three-tier vision
├── CONTRIBUTING.md             # 🤝 Contributor guidelines and onboarding
├── roadmap.md                  # 🗺️ Development timeline and milestones
├── README.md                   # 📖 Basic project information
├── getting-started/
│   └── quick-start.md         # 🚀 5-minute setup guide
├── vision/
│   └── three-tiers.md         # 🏛️ Detailed three-tier system explanation
├── features/                   # 🌟 (ready for content)
├── api/                       # 📋 (ready for API documentation)
